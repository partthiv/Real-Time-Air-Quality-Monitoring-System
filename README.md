"This is a beginner friendly IoT project which uses ThingSpeak cloud platform to collect and analyze sensor data. Based on the obtained sensor data, we actuate other IoT devices."

Users can define their own specific values (thresholds) for air quality levels based on their preferences or the conditions of their environment. For instance, someone might want to set a lower threshold if they are in a particularly sensitive area (like near factories) or a higher threshold if they are in a cleaner area.

## Summary of Modifications
- **User-Defined Thresholds**: Added the ability to set low and high thresholds dynamically through the Serial Monitor.
- **Input Handling**: Incorporated logic to read and parse user input, allowing for easy adjustments without code changes.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: The air quality status messages on the LCD now reflect the user-defined thresholds, enhancing user interaction.
